1)The object list toolbox lists all the assets and lights in the scene.

2)It also contains buttons to add a particular type of light(directional,point or spot).

3)To move in the viewport, use middle mouse scroll for zooming, middle mouse button to orbit and right mouse button to pan.

4)Selecting any asset or light will give you multiple options related to that which can be manipulated by using the scroll or putting in the values directly.(It also contains an option to delete a particular asset or light). 

5)To import a asset, click 'I' key on the keyboard to open the import toolbox. Put the location of the asset and texture along with a name for the asset.
